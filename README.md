**Rich Logging System**

Boolog allows your Rust program to log directly to an HTML file, with optional counterpart logging to the console. This will help developers and managers alike better
visualize what goes on with back-end processes, such as a cloud service or a test suite against REST API calls.
(Boolog is the "spiritual" successor of an automated test logger project created at one of the author's previous places of employment.)

### To install for use in your project

## Example Code
For usage, refer to this example program and Go Doc comments.

[Example Program](src/lib.rs) (Scroll down and look for `fn it_works()` in the `tests` module.)

## Supported Themes

[Themes Poster (GIF)](examples/Poster.gif)

GitHub won't let me directly link to the HTML examples showing each theme (it forces it to resolve as HTML source code).
Instead, I've bundled the examples into a ZIP archive that you can preview on your computer.

![Do this...](examples/Instructions.gif)

To get the archive, click [here](examples/Theme-Examples.zip) and then click the "Download Raw File" icon at right.
