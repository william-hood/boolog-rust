## I'm in the process of translating Boolog into Rust, based on its Go and Kotlin versions.

## Why? --Because I want to learn Rust, and translating an existing piece of my software is the fastest way I can learn a new programming language.

## Watch this space and when Boolog for Rust is ready it'll be announced here.

## Golang version is [here](../boolog-go)

## Kotlin/Java version is [here](../Hoodland-Open-Source-Projects) under its old title "Memoir". Updating Memoir to be Boolog, complete with the new themes, will be my next project after this.

## All of my open source software is released under the MIT license, because that's the one employers like best!
